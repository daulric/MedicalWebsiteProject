                        <h3>Emotional Components in Patient Encounters</h3>
                        <h4>What is it?</h4>
                        <p>The course runs over 10 weeks with sixty-minute-long sessions delivered synchronously and asynchronously. The interactive and experiential learning consists of lectures, group discussions, role-playing scenarios, and reflective and meditative exercises. At the end of the course, the goal is to encourage you to explore your emotional responses, and biases, and to find coping strategies when dealing with emotionally demanding patient interactions.</p>
                        <h4>How can it help build your professional skills?</h4>
                        <p>The course on Emotional Components in Patient Encounters plays a pivotal role in building students' professional skills for the wards and residency training by providing them with essential tools and experiences. Through this course, students develop a nuanced understanding of the emotional dynamics inherent in patient interactions, honing their communication skills, empathy, and cultural competence. By engaging in role-playing scenarios, case studies, and reflective exercises, students learn to navigate complex situations with sensitivity and professionalism, preparing them to handle challenging encounters in real clinical settings. This comprehensive training equips students to deliver empathetic, patient-centered care, effectively collaborate with multidisciplinary teams, and uphold ethical standards, thus laying a strong foundation for their success in the wards and during residency training.</p>
